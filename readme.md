## Symfony books app ##

Simple app which lets user to add authors and books. Each book must have an author existing in the database. Authors can be assigned to many books, but one book can has only one author.
User can also filter books by author and by book name.   
 
I created this app to practise Symfony basics like:
- creating controllers
- creating entities
- creating views in twig
- managing database operations
- creating simple queries to database
